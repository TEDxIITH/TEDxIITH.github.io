  spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like
  experience. At a TEDx event, TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These
  local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference
  provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain
  rules and regulations.)</div>

<div class="TED_is_a_nonprofit_organizatio" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="150">
  <span>TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California
    30 years ago, TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite
    the world’s leading thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available,
    free, at TED.com. TED speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson,
    Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan, and Daniel Kahneman.<br /><br />The annual TED
    Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British Columbia. TED’s media initiatives include TED.com, where
    new TED Talks are posted daily; TED Translators, which provides subtitles and interactive transcripts as well as
    translations from volunteers worldwide; the educational initiative TED-Ed. TED has established The Audacious Project
    that takes a collaborative approach to fund ideas with the potential to create change at thrilling scale; TEDx,
    which supports individuals or groups in hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around the world, and the
    TED Fellows program, helping world-changing innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact of their
    remarkable projects and activities.</span><br>

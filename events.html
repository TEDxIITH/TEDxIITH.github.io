<div class="col-md-12 Jean-Paul_Sartre_an_existentia"  data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="100">
		<span>Jean-Paul Sartre, an existential philosopher, concises it well. Risk-taking is an innate call to claim one’s existence. To exist in your life! Risks are what life throws at you. Sometimes risks come crashing in the life uninvited, while other times you venture out towards it. Risk-taking and playing unsafe is being redefined in the present world context. Breathing life through the pandemic era is like facing war on all fronts, people are pushed to their extremes to come and rethink their comfort positions. Unsafe is the only safest paradigm that ensures existence in the world.  </span><br>

            <h10>Shepal Bhansali is a post-graduate student in Mechanical Engineering. Although he identifies as a
              coffee-loving book reader-cum-hoarder (mostly found in cafes and lawns, amongst other creatures). He is
              what can be called creative or eccentric; he loves (daydreaming about) bike rides with his innate
              skeptical and inquisitive nature, poking around things and people.

              Shreya can be best described by her love for interaction design, striking up conversations (with dogs and
              humans alike), and watches. She chooses to read people over books, and channels that information to become
              a better designer. She talks a lot, but if you keep up, you'd probably learn a thing or two about design,
              planning impromptu trips, or where to find the best masala dosa in Bangalore.

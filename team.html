Although he identifies as a coffee-loving book reader-cum-hoarder, mostly found in cafes and lawns, amongst other creatures. He is what can be called creative and/or eccentric; loves (daydreaming about) bike rides with his innate sceptical and inquisitive nature, poking around things and people. He still believes that ideas are more contagious than COVID-19, with no cure. And thus, he invites y'all to join him in the pandemic of ideas at TEDxIIT Hyderabad.

                        Shreya can be best described by her love for interaction design, striking up conversations (with dogs and humans alike), and watches. She chooses to read people over books, and channels that information to become a better designer. She talks a lot, but if you keep up, you'd probably learn a thing or two about design, planning impromptu trips, or where to find the best masala dosa in Bangalore.
